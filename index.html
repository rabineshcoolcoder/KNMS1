The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. It is the oldest form of drama, though live theatre has now been joined by modern recorded forms. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience.Places, normally buildings, where performances regularly take place are also called "theatres" (or "theaters"), as derived from the Ancient Greek ("a place for viewing"), itself and from ("to see", "to watch", "to observe").</b></p>

          <p class="spelling">A spelling bee is a competition in which contestants are asked to spell a broad selection of words, usually with a varying degree of difficulty. To compete, contestants must memorize the spellings of words as written in dictionaries, and recite them accordingly. The concept is thought to have originated in the United States, and is almost exclusive to the English language. Spelling bee events, along with variants, are now also held in some other countries around the world.Historically the word bee has been used to describe a get-together for communal work, like a husking bee, a quilting bee, or an apple bee. According to etymological research recorded in dictionaries, the word bee probably comes from dialectal been or bean (meaning "help given by neighbors"), which came from Middle English bene (meaning "prayer", "boon" and "extra service by a tenant to his lord").</p>

          <p class="spelling">Stories always give wings to our imagination and take us to places beyond the boundaries of physical world. While competitions are the best way to boost the confidence in children. Keeping this in mind, a storytelling competition was conducted for Grades Nursery and Prep. Children narrated stories like ‘The five friends’, ‘Thirsty crow’, ‘The lion and the mouse’, etc. Some of them were dressed up as characters and presented their story with the use of facial expressions and voice modulation. To captivate the audience's attention, the little narrators of Presidium used props like puppets. Each and every story was recited with a moral. The oratory and presentation skills of tiny tots were outstanding.</p>

          <p class="spelling">In sports, racing is a competition of speed, in which competitors try to complete a given task in the shortest amount of time. Typically this involves traversing some distance, but it can be any other task involving speed to reach a specific goal. A race may be run continuously to finish or may be made up of several segments called heats, stages or legs. A heat is usually run over the same course at different times. A stage is a shorter section of a much longer course or a time trial. Early records of races are evident on pottery from ancient Greece, which depicted running men vying for first place. A chariot race is described in Homer's Iliad.</p>
